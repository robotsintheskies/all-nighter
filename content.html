               <p> 
                 As one of the managers of Carr Haus, sometimes it’s my job to be on Facebook. (Actually.) About a month ago I used the Carr Haus page to announce that we were re-naming the cafe’s gallery space. I was kind of hoping for excitement and a deluge of suggestions. Instead, I got one: “Carr Haus Gallery has a nice ring to it!’” I then deleted that whole situation.</p>

                <p>The truth is, we’re re-dedicating the walls to a faculty member whose involvement with Carr Haus deserves more recognition than we can give. It’s kind of a crazy story, and a piece of RISD history that I’m proud of. Carr Haus Cafe, the same place which currently displays Occupy artifacts in a protest-themed exhibition, was born during an occupy-style protest, as a means to feed the protesters who squatted in the building. And the instigator of these protests is Michael Fink, longtime Liberal Arts faculty member.</p>

                <p>In the early 70′s Mike was long-bearded and outspoken. When he heard rumors that Carr Haus “was going to be bulldozed, I said, ‘Only with me in it.’” Carr Haus had been a dorm in the 30′s, and was now home to liberal arts classrooms and offices, including Mike’s own. It was essentially the liberal arts building. But the administration had grown tired of keeping the historical structure within fire code, and the president had made plans to demolish it and reappropriate the space. However, Mike felt that the idiosyncratic Victorian gem was a bit like the soul of his department, and he resented the squashing of it. He began a heated campaign in the student-run paper to save the building, wherein fellow faculty remarked that his “indiscretion and desperation was exceeded only by his elegant prose.” Mike recently chuckled with me about how aggressive his letters were. In fact, his letters were so brash that he was actually fired for them. But that president who fired him via private letter resigned soon after, and Mike, in keeping with his brazen style, simply stayed.</p>

                <p>When he decided to stay overnight in the building, too, around the time the bulldozing was set to happen, he was joined by others. Then: “the next day, much to our surprise, no one kicked us out. Students were sleeping in rooms upstairs and coming downstairs to eat.” The building was emptied of furniture, so the students sat on tree stumps. (Trees were being cut down outside in preparation for the bulldozing.) A communal sharing of coffee spontaneously occurred when they found a coffee pot. For several days they coexisted and shared food.</p>

                <p>After several weeks, the unofficial student-run coffee house was still going. Since it wasn’t going away, the administration finally endorsed it. In 1970 RISD president Talbot Rantoul visited it, admitted it was a “pleasant place,” and allowed it for student use “for the time being.”</p>

               <p>Now, “the time being” has turned into over 40 years, and Carr Haus remains. It has an official visage—it houses CSI, and many hardworking individuals in Student Affairs, as well as a fully functional cafe with four managers and nearly 40 student staff members. But it still retains a kind of “unofficial” air. This campus hub was claimed–or rather, pried with a determined hand–against the administration’s wishes, and against the odds. The cafe is still student-run. The gallery within it is still the only student-run gallery space on RISD’s campus. So we’re going to name it after the man who both founded and saved it, and dubbed it as our defiant little “soul.”</p>

                <p>If you’re a fan of Mike Fink, you should definitely join us for the dedication ceremony taking place within the cafe on Tuesday May 15th at 6:30pm. But if you want to hear the protest story firsthand, you should stop by the College Building, his new official home, and have a chat. Mike’s current office is an elaborate cave of wonders, decorated floor-to-ceiling with artwork and tokens from past students who have been affected by him. Likewise, Mike himself is a treasure trove of stories. My earnest hope is for them to be honored and shared</p>
